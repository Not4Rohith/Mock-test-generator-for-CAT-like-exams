      "context_passage": "[Fifty] years after its publication in English [in 1972], and just a year since [Marshall] Sahlins himself died—we may ask: why did [his essay] \"Original Affluent Society\" have such an impact, and how has it fared since? ... Sahlins's principal argument was simple but counterintuitive: before being driven into marginal environments by colonial powers, huntergatherers, or foragers, were not engaged in a desperate struggle for meager survival. Quite the contrary, they satisfied their needs with far less work than people in agricultural and industrial societies, leaving them more time to use as they wished. Hunters, he quipped, keep bankers' hours. Refusing to maximize, many were \"more concerned with games of chance than with chances of game.\" . . . The so-called Neolithic Revolution, rather than improving life, imposed a harsher work regime and set in motion the long history of growing inequality ...\nMoreover, foragers had other options. The contemporary Hadza of Tanzania, who had long been surrounded by farmers, knew they had alternatives and rejected them. To Sahlins, this showed that foragers are not simply examples of human diversity or victimhood but something more profound: they demonstrated that societies make real choices. Culture, a way of living oriented around a distinctive set of values, manifests a fundamental principle of collective self determination. . .\nBut the point [of the essay] is not so much the empirical validity of the data-the real interest for most readers, after all, is not in foragers either today or in the Paleolithic-but rather its conceptual challenge to contemporary economic life and bourgeois individualism. The empirical served a philosophical and political project, a thought experiment and stimulus to the imagination of possibilities.\nWith its title's nod toward The Affluent Society (1958), economist John Kenneth Galbraith's famously skeptical portrait of America's postwar prosperity and inequality, and dripping with New Left contempt for consumerism, \"The Original Affluent Society\" brought this critical perspective to bear on the contemporary world. It did so through the classic anthropological move of showing that radical alternatives to the readers' lives really exist. If the capitalist world seeks wealth through ever greater material production to meet infinitely expansive desires, foraging societies follow \"the Zen road to affluence\": not by getting more, but by wanting less. If it seems that foragers have been left behind by \"progress,\" this is due only to the ethnocentric self-congratulation of the West. Rather than accumulate material goods, these societies are guided by other values: leisure, mobility, and above all, freedom. . .\nViewed in today's context, of course, not every aspect of the essay has aged well. While acknowledging the violence of colonialism, racism, and dispossession, it does not thematize them as heavily as we might today.

When beliefs previously held as truths are rendered implausible, new beliefs, values, and ways of living may be required. _ (2) .

In English, there is no systematic rule for the naming of numbers; after ten, we have \"eleven\" and \"twelve\" and then the teens: \"thirteen\", \"fourteen\", \"fifteen\" and so on.\n2. Even more confusingly, some English words invert the numbers they refer to: the word \"fourteen\" puts the four first, even though it appears last.\n3. It can take children a while to learn all these words, and understand that \"fourteen\" is different from \"forty\".\n4. For multiples of 10, English speakers switch to a different pattern: \"twenty\", \"thirty\", \"forty\" and so on.\n5. If you didn't know the word for \"eleven\", you would be unable to just guess it you might come up with something like \"one-teen\".",

Having an appreciation for the workings of another person’s mind is considered a prerequisite for natural language acquisition, strategic social interaction, reflexive thought, and moral judgment.\n2. It is a ‘theory of mind’ though some scholars prefer to call it ‘mentalizing’ or ‘mindreading’, which is important for the development of one's cognitive abilities.\n3. Though we must speculate about its evolutionary origin, we do have indications that the capacity evolved sometime in the last few million years.\n4. This capacity develops from early beginnings in the first year of life to the adult’s fast and often effortless understanding of others’ thoughts, feelings, and intentions.\n5. One of the most fascinating human capacities is the ability to perceive and interpret other people’s behaviour in terms of their mental states.",

Algorithms hosted on the internet are accessed by many, so biases in Al models have resulted in much larger impact, adversely affecting far larger groups of people.\n2. Though \"algorithmic bias\" is the popular term, the foundation of such bias is not in algorithms, but in the data; algorithms are not biased, data is, as algorithms merely reflect persistent patterns that are present in the training data.\n3. Despite their widespread impact, it is relatively easier to fix Al biases than human-generated biases, as it is simpler to identify the former than to try to make people unlearn behaviors learnt over generations.\n4.

A record dates back to ancient Rome, when Antony met Cleopatra and his political enemy Octavian launched a smear campaign against him with \"short, sharp slogans written upon coins.\" The perpetrator became the first Roman Emperor and \"fake news had allowed Octavian to hack the republican system once and for all\". But the 21st century has seen the weaponization of information on an unprecedented scale. Powerful new technology makes the fabrication of content simple, and social networks amplify falsehoods peddled by States, populist politicians, and dishonest corporate entities.

World history is full of examples of one society gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent territory and settling its people on newly conquered territory. In the sixteenth century, colonialism changed decisively because of technological developments in navigation that began to connect more remote parts of the world. The modern European colonial project emerged when it became possible to move large numbers of people across the ocean and to maintain political control in spite of geographical dispersion.

The diagram also shows two roads, one passing in front of the houses in Row-2 and another between the two blocks.\n\nSome of the houses are occupied. The remaining ones are vacant and are the only ones available for sale.\nThe road adjacency value of a house is the number of its sides adjacent to a road. For example, the road adjacency values of C2, F2, and B1 are 2, 1, and 0, respectively. The neighbour count of a house is the number of sides of that house adjacent to occupied houses in the same block. For example, E1 and C1 can have the maximum possible neighbour counts of 3 and 2, respectively.\nThe base price of a vacant house is Rs. 10 lakhs if the house does not have a parking space, and Rs. 12 lakhs if it does. The quoted price (in lakhs of Rs.) of a vacant house is calculated as (base price) + 5 × (road adjacency value) + 3 × (neighbour count).\nThe following information is also known.\n1. The maximum quoted price of a house in Block XX is Rs. 24 lakhs. The minimum quoted price of a house in block YY is Rs. 15 lakhs, and one such house is in Column E.\n2. Row-1 has two occupied houses, one in each block.\n3. Both houses in Column-E are vacant. Each of Column-D and Column-F has at least one occupied house.\n4. There is only one house with parking space in Block YY.",

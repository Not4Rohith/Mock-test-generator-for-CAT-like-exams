A megacity consists of the city proper and its adjoining suburban centers. An example is the New York-Newark aggregation, which in 1950 was the world\u2019s only megacity; by 2011, it was the sixth largest of 21 megacities.

An example is the New York-Newark aggregation, which in 1950 was the world\u2019s only megacity; by 2011, it was the sixth largest of 21 megacities. The population of Greater Tokyo, the world\u2019s largest urban area and home to 36.7 million residents, is forecast to exceed 37 million by 2020.Megaciites Mumbai, Delhi, Dhaka, and Lagos, which do not yet appear on the Top Ten list, are steadily moving up the ladder. About half of the world\u2019s urban dwellers live in cities of under half a million people, and these cities continue to outpace megacities in growth.\nWhile the benefits of developed infrastructure, public transportation system, employment opportunities, better health care, and education, plus a wide range of services, make cities the place to live, work, and enjoy, they are plagued with enormous problems. As engines of growth, cities have also become engines of pollution, traffic congestion, waste production, and environmental destruction\u2026.\nIn the 1960s, the concept of urban ecology emerged from the growing awareness of cities\u2019 impact on the environment. In 1975, the nonprofit organization Urban Ecology was founded in Berkeley, California, with the purpose of rebuilding cities in balance with nature. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro established Agenda 21, a plan for the sustainable development of cities, and in 2002, 1,200 representatives (including 200 slum dwellers) from 80 countries participated in the first World Urban Forum, making urban ecology and sustainable eco-cities based on environment, economy, education, equity more than just a nice idea.",

        "context_passage": "The human body is nothing but a set of chemical reactions in some form or the other. The religious scriptures believe that man was made out of the image of the creator of the universe. Does this mean that Oxygen was pumped into the human body and carbon dioxide pumped out to create this being? Is life just the process of oxygenation and decarburization? If the human body is managed by these two processes, then we can safely believe that life came into existence due to these chemical reactions. The highly complex chemicals compounds present in the human body are not evident in lower animals or plants. These substances were born because of the synthesis of other smaller molecules.\nA large number of recognized chemicals has been observed and provedto be involved in the transmission of impulses from one tissue or cell to another. Some examples of such chemicals are adrenaline, dopamine, acetylcholine, endorphins and encephalin. The increase or decrease of any one of these chemicals, interferes with the normal functioning of cells and tissues. This creates diseases in the body, and the restoration of their supply cures the diseases. The deficiency of acetylcholine leads to Alzheimer's disease, while a decrease in dopamine leads to Parkinson's disease and its increase causes schizophrenia, a mental disorder. Endorphins and encephalon work like a drug to produce sensations like pleasure and reduce pain. In depressed persons, lower levels of serotonin and adrenaline are observed. Exercise and meditation help release endorphins in order to produce a scene of calmness and pleasure. As for love, the brain releases a chemical substance called phenyl ethylene which acts like an amphetamineto increase mental alertness and physical energy. People with low levels of these chemicals develop a craving for foods such as chocolates, which are rich in such compounds.",

    "passage_text": "In contrast to traditional analyses of minority business, the sociological analysis contends that minority business ownership is a group-level phenomenon, in that it is largely dependent upon social-group resources for its development. Specifically. this analysis indicates that support networksplay critical role in starting and maintaining minority business enterprises by providing owners with a range of assistance, from the informal encouragementof family members and friends to dependable sources of labor andclientele from the owner's ethnic group. Suchself-help networks, which encourage and support ethnic minority entrepreneurs, consist of \"primary\" institutions, those closest to the individual in shaping his or her behavior and beliefs. They are characterized by the face-to-face association and cooperation of persons united by ties of mutual concern. They form an intermediate social level between the individual and larger \"secondary\"institutions based on impersonal relationships. Primary institutions comprising the support network include kinship, peer. and neighborhood or community subgroups. A major function of self-help networks is financial support. Most scholars agree that minority business owners have dependedprimarily on family funds and ethnic community resources for investmentcapital. Personal savings have been accumulated, often through frugal living habits that require sacrifices by the entire family and are thus a product of long-term family financial behavior. Additional loans andgifts from relatives, forthcoming because of group obligation rather than narrow investment calculation, have supplemented personal savings. Individual entrepreneurs do not necessarily rely on their kin because they cannot obtain financial backing from commercial resources. They may actually avoid banks because they assume that commercial institutions either cannot comprehend the special needs of minority enterprise or charge unreasonably high interest rates. Within the larger ethnic community, rotating credit associations have been usedto raise capital. These associations are informal clubs of friends and other trusted members of the ethnic group who make regular contributions to a fund that is given to each contributor in rotation. One author estimates that 40 percent of New York Chinatown firms established during 1900-1950 utilized such associations as their initial source of capital. However, recent immigrants andthird or fourth generationsof older groups now employrotating credit associations only occasionally to raise investment funds. Some groups, like Black Americans, found other means of financial support for their entrepreneurial efforts. The first Black-operated banks were created in the late nineteenth century as depositories for dues) collected from fraternal or lodge groups. which themselves had sprung from Black churches. Black banks made limited investments in other Black enterprises. Irish immigrants in American cities organized many building and loan associations to provide capital for home construction and purchase. They, in turn, provided work for many Irish home-building contractor firms. Other ethnic and minority groups followed similar practices in founding ethnic-directed financial institutions.

Specifically. this analysis indicates that support networksplay critical role in starting and maintaining minority business enterprises by providing owners with a range of assistance, from the informal encouragementof family members and friends to dependable sources of labor andclientele from the owner's ethnic group. Suchself-help networks, which encourage and support ethnic minority entrepreneurs, consist of \"primary\" institutions, those closest to the individual in shaping his or her behavior and beliefs. They are characterized by the face-to-face association and cooperation of persons united by ties of mutual concern. They form an intermediate social level between the individual and larger \"secondary\"institutions based on impersonal relationships. Primary institutions comprising the support network include kinship, peer. and neighborhood or community subgroups. A major function of self-help networks is financial support. Most scholars agree that minority business owners have dependedprimarily on family funds and ethnic community resources for investmentcapital. Personal savings have been accumulated, often through frugal living habits that require sacrifices by the entire family and are thus a product of long-term family financial behavior. Additional loans andgifts from relatives, forthcoming because of group obligation rather than narrow investment calculation, have supplemented personal savings. Individual entrepreneurs do not necessarily rely on their kin because they cannot obtain financial backing from commercial resources. They may actually avoid banks because they assume that commercial institutions either cannot comprehend the special needs of minority enterprise or charge unreasonably high interest rates. Within the larger ethnic community, rotating credit associations have been usedto raise capital. These associations are informal clubs of friends and other trusted members of the ethnic group who make regular contributions to a fund that is given to each contributor in rotation. One author estimates that 40 percent of New York Chinatown firms established during 1900-1950 utilized such associations as their initial source of capital. However, recent immigrants andthird or fourth generationsof older groups now employrotating credit associations only occasionally to raise investment funds. Some groups, like Black Americans, found other means of financial support for their entrepreneurial efforts. The first Black-operated banks were created in the late nineteenth century as depositories for dues) collected from fraternal or lodge groups. which themselves had sprung from Black churches. Black banks made limited investments in other Black enterprises. Irish immigrants in American cities organized many building and loan associations to provide capital for home construction and purchase. They, in turn, provided work for many Irish home-building contractor firms. Other ethnic and minority groups followed similar practices in founding ethnic-directed financial institutions.

    "passage_text": "Philosophy of Education is a label applied to the study of the purpose, process, nature and ideals of education. It can be considered a branch of both philosophy and education. Education can be defined as the teaching and learning of specific skills and imparting of knowledge, judgment and wisdom, is something broader than the societal institution of education we often speak of.\nMany educationalists consider it a weak and woolly field, too far removed from the practical applications of the real world to be useful. But philosophers dating back to Plato and the Ancient Greeks have given the area much thought and emphasis, and there is little doubt that their work has helped shape the practice of education over the millennia.\nPlato is the earliest important educational thinker, and education is an essential element in \"The Republic\" (his most important work on philosophy and political theory, written around 360 B.C.).

    "passage_text": "What advice would I give to new entrepreneurs who need funding? Forget about your business plan and buy a lottery ticket – your chances are better. My point is that when you need venture funding no one will give any money until you already have a marketable product. In other words, funding comes just when you do not need it. A myth is that the way to start a venture is to create a great business plan, perfect your pitch, and then present this to investors, starting with venture capitalists. If that does not work, you knock on the door of angel investors. But ask any entrepreneur who has called on venture capitalists and they will probably tell you that it is almost impossible to even get calls returned. If venture capitalists do respond and you are invited to present your idea, the process will drag on for many months while you borrow more and survive on hope. If you do hit the jackpot, you are required to let the investors make many of the business decisions in exchange for an investment. To be fair, most business plans do not deserve funding. Venture capitalists receive hundreds of plans every week, and few are worth the paper they are printed on. Everyone jumps on the same new trend, or the ideas are so far out that they have no chance of success. And great ideas are not enough: it takes experienced management, excellent execution, and a receptive market. It is hard for even the best venture capitals to identify the potential successes. So what should an entrepreneur do? What all new entrepreneurs should understand is that, even if you have a realistic business plan for a great idea that can change the world, you need to develop it yourself until you can prove it. Focus on validating your idea and building it up. Raise money to get started by begging and borrowing from family and friends. And be prepared to dip into your savings and credit cards, obtain second mortgages, and perhaps look for consulting work or customer advances. There is no single recipe for developing your business idea yourself, but there are some essential ingredients. Here are some pointers: Consult widely. Share your ideas with those who have done it before. You can learn a lot from the experience of seasoned entrepreneurs, and they are much more approachable than you think. If you cannot find anyone who is excited about your idea, the chances are it is not worth being excited about. This may be time to reflect deeply and come up with another. Identify markets. Speak to anyone who can help you understand your target customers. If you can sell your concept, some customers may help you find it or agree to be a test site or a valuable reference. Customers do not usually know what they want, but they always know what they do not need. Make sure that there is a real need for your product. Start small. Your idea may be grand and have the potential to change the world, but you are only going to do this one step at a time. Look for simple solutions, test them and learn from the feedback. If you are starting a restaurant, work for some one else first. If you are creating a software product, learn by doing some consulting assignments or create some utilities. You do not have to start with the ultimate product. Watch every penny. Focus on revenue and profitability from the start. Find creative ways to earn cash by selling tactical products, prepaid licenses or royalties. Pay employees partially in stock. Look for access to free hardware or premises. And sweep the floors yourself. In short, use any methods to avoid costs. Prepare for the worst. It is going to take longer than you think. There will likely be product problems, unhappy customers, employee turnover, and lots of financial challenges. You may even fail a number of times before you achieve your goals. By learning from each success and failure alike, you increase the odds that you eventually make it. Keep your integrity. Never forget the importance of business ethics and your own values. Ethics need to be carefully sewn into the fabric of any start-up. And the only way to reach long-term success is by achieving outstanding customer satisfaction. With a lot of luck and hard work you may build a successful company that markets products customers really want.",

What all new entrepreneurs should understand is that, even if you have a realistic business plan for a great idea that can change the world, you need to develop it yourself until you can prove it. Focus on validating your idea and building it up. Raise money to get started by begging and borrowing from family and friends. And be prepared to dip into your savings and credit cards, obtain second mortgages, and perhaps look for consulting work or customer advances. There is no single recipe for developing your business idea yourself, but there are some essential ingredients. Here are some pointers: Consult widely. Share your ideas with those who have done it before. You can learn a lot from the experience of seasoned entrepreneurs, and they are much more approachable than you think. If you cannot find anyone who is excited about your idea, the chances are it is not worth being excited about. This may be time to reflect deeply and come up with another. Identify markets. Speak to anyone who can help you understand your target customers. If you can sell your concept, some customers may help you find it or agree to be a test site or a valuable reference. Customers do not usually know what they want, but they always know what they do not need. Make sure that there is a real need for your product. Start small. Your idea may be grand and have the potential to change the world, but you are only going to do this one step at a time. Look for simple solutions, test them and learn from the feedback. If you are starting a restaurant, work for some one else first. If you are creating a software product, learn by doing some consulting assignments or create some utilities. You do not have to start with the ultimate product. Watch every penny. Focus on revenue and profitability from the start. Find creative ways to earn cash by selling tactical products, prepaid licenses or royalties. Pay employees partially in stock. Look for access to free hardware or premises. And sweep the floors yourself. In short, use any methods to avoid costs. Prepare for the worst. It is going to take longer than you think. There will likely be product problems, unhappy customers, employee turnover, and lots of financial challenges. You may even fail a number of times before you achieve your goals. By learning from each success and failure alike, you increase the odds that you eventually make it. Keep your integrity. Never forget the importance of business ethics and your own values. Ethics need to be carefully sewn into the fabric of any start-up. And the only way to reach long-term success is by achieving outstanding customer satisfaction. With a lot of luck and hard work you may build a successful company that markets products customers really want.",

The newspaper and journals that Tilak and other reformers ran, the books they wrote, sold little, but had an enormous effect. Their writing was known to reflect and be just an extension of, their exemplary lives. It was the authenticity of their lives which lent weight to their message, to their example. All knew that their lives were an integral whole - they were not moral in public life and lacking in private, or vice versa. They were not full of pious thoughts and sacred resolutions within the walls of a temple. A writer who is merely entertaining his readers, even one who is merely informing them, can do what he wants with the rest of his life. But the writer, who sets out to use his pen to reform public life, can not afford such dualities. Here is the testimony of one great man - about the influence of another, Lokmanya Tilak. \"I believe that an editor who has anything worth saying and who commands a clientele cannot easily be hushed. He delivered his finished message as soon as he is put under duress. Tilak spoke more eloquently from the Mandalay fortress than through columns of the printed Kesari. His influence was multiplied a thousandfold by his imprisonment and his speech and his pen had acquired much greater power after he was discharged than before his imprisonment. By his death we have been editing his paper without pen and speech through the sacred resolution of the people to realize his life's dream. He could possibly have done more if he were today in flesh preaching his view. Critics like me would perhaps be still finding fault in the expression of this or that.

In other words, the role the salesperson must play has to be identified. There are three different processes sales staff can adopt: narrative, suggestive and consultative. The narrative approach depends on the salesperson moving quickly into a standardized presentation. Every buyer receives the same presentation. Emphasis is on highlighting benefits and how the product or service can help the buyer. This is an effective approach if the buying motive for all customers is the same. This process is well suited where there are a great number of prospectuses to be called on. The suggestive approach depends on the seller being in a position to offer alternative recommendations. This is quite different from the narrative approach as the presentation is tailored to the individual customer. Here, the salesperson must initiate some discussion in order to get the buyer in a positive frame of mind. An example of this process would be a restaurant wine steward who has checked with the waiter what food the customer has ordered and then opens by saying that either \"this or that\" particular wine would go best with the food ordered. This is an excellent approach where one doesn't have much time with the customer but is able to acquire some basic information and then offer a particular recommendation. This process is well suited for products and services. However, it does require the salesperson to acquire basic information from the customer before moving on to the presentation. The consultative approach requires the salesperson to have a thorough understanding of the customer and what the customer is trying to achieve. The role of the salesperson is to become an adviser or consultant and she must acquire a great deal of information from the customer. With this information, the salesperson can plan what to offer the customer. In this case, the salesperson must tailor the presentation to highlight how the salesperson's product or service can be of help. This approach will usually require a number of sales calls as the buying process may be complex. The consultative approach requires a wide variety of skills, including probing, listening, analysis, creativity and persuasiveness. The latter two approaches typically require fewer skills. Hiring, training, motivating and rewarding sales people needs to be linked to the type of sales process being used and this is where the problem starts. Many organizations, which are using a consultative approach, use a narrative approach. They use standardized methods and do not tailor presentations to individual customers. You see this in many industries. When this is the case, price becomes a key criterion for the customer. A key issue in developing a professional sales organization is first establishing the sales process. When that decision has been made, all other sales decision, including hiring, training and rewards can be linked to it.",

One of the keys to becoming more effective is to first determine the type of \"selling process” which needs to be used. In other words, the role the salesperson must play has to be identified. There are three different processes sales staff can adopt: narrative, suggestive and consultative. The narrative approach depends on the salesperson moving quickly into a standardized presentation. Every buyer receives the same presentation. Emphasis is on highlighting benefits and how the product or service can help the buyer. This is an effective approach if the buying motive for all customers is the same. This process is well suited where there are a great number of prospectuses to be called on. The suggestive approach depends on the seller being in a position to offer alternative recommendations. This is quite different from the narrative approach as the presentation is tailored to the individual customer. Here, the salesperson must initiate some discussion in order to get the buyer in a positive frame of mind. An example of this process would be a restaurant wine steward who has checked with the waiter what food the customer has ordered and then opens by saying that either \"this or that\" particular wine would go best with the food ordered. This is an excellent approach where one doesn't have much time with the customer but is able to acquire some basic information and then offer a particular recommendation. This process is well suited for products and services. However, it does require the salesperson to acquire basic information from the customer before moving on to the presentation. The consultative approach requires the salesperson to have a thorough understanding of the customer and what the customer is trying to achieve. The role of the salesperson is to become an adviser or consultant and she must acquire a great deal of information from the customer. With this information, the salesperson can plan what to offer the customer. In this case, the salesperson must tailor the presentation to highlight how the salesperson's product or service can be of help. This approach will usually require a number of sales calls as the buying process may be complex. The consultative approach requires a wide variety of skills, including probing, listening, analysis, creativity and persuasiveness. The latter two approaches typically require fewer skills.

It is the transformation of our play and games into athletics that leads to medals. What makes Haryana such a fine place for athletics in India? With barely 2% of India's population, people from Haryana won around 40% of the gold medals in the recently concluded CWG 2010. People in Haryana tend to count the gold medals of the Hyderabadi shuttler, Saina Nehwal and the Delhi wrestler, Sushil Kumar, in their tally. This is because both of them are Jats. People of this dominant caste form more than 20% of Haryana's population and, therefore, in popular perception, Haryana is Jat-land. All sports are oriented towards the Olympic slogan 'higher, faster, and stronger'. But the ones in which Haryana got medals stand for plain force and aggression like wrestling, boxing and shooting. Anthropologists call them contact sports because the opponents have bodily contact in them. Shooting is a combative sport because opponents use a combat weapon. Such sports are a substitute of war or training for it.\nHaryana is India's pride in contact and combative games. I can think of t hree reasons for it, viz. historical geography, peasant culture of perseverance and a feeble government policy. Firstly, the province has a volatile history of continuous aggression due to its geographical location on the frontier. Secondly, the people of Haryana have valued physical strength and perseverance due to its peasant culture. Thirdly, the sports policy since 2006 has honed the killer athletic spirit in Haryana. The half-hearted policy does not create achievers but supports the successful ones among them. Punjab was divided on religious lines in 1947. The non-Sikh majority parts of this truncated Punjab were constituted as Haryana in 1966. Like a horseshoe, Haryana encircles Delhi from three sides and the culture of both is similar. At the popular level, people are rough and tough - meaning 'rough by tongue and tough in body'. In the medieval times, Haryana flourished when weak rulers ruled Delhi. Most of the area remained under Delhi's tutelage but small principalities also dotted the arid landscape of Haryana. Mostly, people of the region joined the Mughals and Marathas in repulsing invaders. But the same locals did not mind plundering Delhi or looting the retreating armies sometimes. The British colonialists expanded from the east. They conquered most of India with the help of soldiers from western UP and Bihar. But, in the late 19th century, the colonial strategists honored ordinary peasant castes by calling them 'martial races' in united Punjab. This was a clever way of taming the aggression in this frontier region. This smart move was also to recruit rural Punjabis in the colonial army so that they could be used to thwart the southward expansion of Tsarist Russia. There is a family resemblance between military/hunting activities and wrestling, shooting, races, riding or archery. For the military serving population of Haryana, therefore, such sports come easily. Secondly, before the advent of machinery, agriculture was a backbreaking occupation. The size of agricultural income had a direct relation with the quantity of sweat produced during one's toil.",

The two conflicts have reshaped Russia, Chechnya, their rulers - and those who oppose them. In 1994, shortly after Moscow invaded Chechnya in an effort to restore its territorial integrity, Akhmad Kadyrov, a bearded, barrel-chested Muslim scholar turned guerrilla commander, declared jihad on all Russians and said each Chechen should kill at least 150 of them.\nThat was the proportion of the populations on each side of the conflict: some 150 million Russians and less than a million Chechens in a small, landlocked province, which the separatists wanted to carve out of Russia. Western media and politicians dubbed the Chechens \"freedom fighters\" - an army of Davids fighting the Russian Goliath.\nMoscow was lambasted internationally for disproportionate use of force and rolling back on the democratic freedoms that former leader Boris Yeltsin was so eager to introduce after the 1991 Soviet Union collapse. Tens of thousands died amid atrocities committed by both sides - and many more were displaced before 1996, when the Russians retreated, leaving Chechnya essentially independent. Retreating was a humiliation for Russia's military machine that less than a decade earlier had presented a seemingly formidable threat to the entire Western world.",

Western media and politicians dubbed the Chechens \"freedom fighters\" - an army of Davids fighting the Russian Goliath.\nMoscow was lambasted internationally for disproportionate use of force and rolling back on the democratic freedoms that former leader Boris Yeltsin was so eager to introduce after the 1991 Soviet Union collapse. Tens of thousands died amid atrocities committed by both sides - and many more were displaced before 1996, when the Russians retreated, leaving Chechnya essentially independent. Retreating was a humiliation for Russia's military machine that less than a decade earlier had presented a seemingly formidable threat to the entire Western world.",
